==================================================
== Limits on maximum number of states in automaton:

(1) A_trim reserves the values MAXSHORT and MAXSHORT - 1 as sentinals.
Hence, max number of states <= MAXSHORT - 2.

(2) A_lameq reserves the values MAXSHORT and MAXSHORT - 1 as sentinals.
Hence, max number of states <= MAXSHORT - 2.

(3) A_lamcm reserves the values MAXSHORT and MAXSHORT - 1 as sentinals.
Hence, max number of states <= MAXSHORT - 2.
