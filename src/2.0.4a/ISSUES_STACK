==================================================
== Limits on maximum stack size

(1) A_trim does a deep recursion that reaches a depth of the maximum path
length from the start state. Each frame has 2 SHORTs and a pointer (12 bytes).

(2) A_lameq does a deep recursion that reaches a depth of the maximum path
length from the start state. Each frame has 2 ints and 2 pointers (24 bytes).
***** could these 2 ints be SHORTs?
***** could one of the pointers be eliminated?

(2) A_lamcm does a deep recursion that reaches a depth of the maximum path
length from the start state. Each frame has 1 int (4 bytes).
