# INR main

## Installation

INR is a C program that will compile and run comfortably in a LINUX
environment or one sufficiently similar to it.
The only dependencies are *gcc*, *make* and *yacc* (as provided by *bison*).

There is a make file in the src directory that will do the proper build and
produce an executable *ginr*.

## Usage

Limited documentation in the form of a PDF file was produced in 2010 as part
of the release under GPL version 3:
[PDF](doc/inr_intro.pdf).
See also [USAGE.md](USAGE.md) extracted from the latex source using pandoc
and with some long-standing errors corrected.
