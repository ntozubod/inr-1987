# INR 1987

A prototype FST toolkit developed between 1983-1987 at University of Waterloo

## Statement of Purpose for this Repo

This repository contains a old versions of INR from 1987 and 1988 that
represent the endpoint of the development done by me at the University
of Waterloo as part of my research project into theory and applications
of Finite State Transductions.
These old versions have no claims to ownership other than mine and I never
surrendered these rights.
Based on this claim, I released these materials with bug fixes in 2010
under a GPL version 3 license (with permission of my then employer).

The goal of this repo is to provide a workshop for exploring new directions
for INR development and application.
There are and will be ideas incompletely explored and it will be messy.
As ideas with their implementations, documentation, and use cases mature
they will be copied across to the *ginr* repository.

Here will be a more rapid update cycle and much tentative work.
If you, the reader, have any qualms about this, look only at the *ginr*
repo.
It contains all of the important changes, though perhaps buried deep in
branches.
